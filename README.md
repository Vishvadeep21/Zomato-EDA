# Zomato Dataset Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)

## Introduction  
This project performs **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)** on the Zomato dataset to uncover insights about restaurant distribution, ratings, costs, and customer preferences. The goal is to understand patterns in the food industry that could help restaurants, businesses, and customers make better decisions.  

## Dataset  
- The dataset contains information about restaurants, including location, type, rating, votes, and approximate cost for two people.  
- Preprocessing steps include handling missing values, removing duplicates, and normalizing categorical values.  

## Objectives  
- Clean and preprocess the dataset.  
- Explore restaurant ratings, cuisines, and cost distribution.  
- Analyze location-based patterns.  
- Visualize insights using plots and charts.  

## Tools & Libraries  
- **Programming Language:** Python  
- **Libraries:** Pandas, NumPy, Matplotlib, Seaborn  

## Exploratory Analysis  
- Restaurant type distribution  
- Rating trends and their correlation with votes  
- Cost distribution across cities  
- Most popular cuisines  
- Location-wise insights  

## Results  
- Identified the most common restaurant types and cuisines.  
- Found that ratings correlate with votes and cost in certain segments.  
- Discovered popular food hubs based on location data.  
- Generated visualizations for trends and comparisons.  

## Future Work  
- Implement **Machine Learning models** for restaurant rating prediction.  
- Create **interactive dashboards** using Plotly or Power BI.  
- Expand analysis with real-time datasets.
